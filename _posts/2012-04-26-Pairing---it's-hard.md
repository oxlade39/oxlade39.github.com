## Background
For over two years I worked in a team that followed agile processes, including [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/). The team is quite large, at a conservative estimate I'd say; maybe 6 sub-teams of 6 cross discipline members. All sub-teams working against the same 2 week cycle from the same plan. Sub-teams are fairly self organised and have their own targets (stories).

Of the 2 teams I was a member, both used [pair programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) heavily. The first &gt; 90%, the second maybe 75% (I was running the second) of the working day. This is a collection of my thoughts an experiences from that time.

## What is pair programming
Well, it's very much like it's described in [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html). Two people sit at the same computer, usually with a single mouse and a single keyboard working together to deliver a piece of functionality. If you're lucky you'll have two massive cinema displays and all plugged into a top of the range [Mac Pro](http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_pro).

### What you tell friends and family
Now when friends and family ask you what's it's like at work and you tell them about pairing, they wonder what the hell you're on about. 

- 'You get paid to sit and watch someone else type?'
- 'Yeah sure, it's great. Sometimes you get in with a hangover and let them do all the work!'. 

That last bit -my answer- is __a lie__, I've told a variation of it many times. 

When people ask what you do for a job, they are only vaguely interested. They don't want to hear this blog post, _in full_. If truth be told, people react better to that kind of description (lie).

The hangover bit, it really is a lie. Don't come in to work extremely hungover, breath alcohol all over your pair and be generally incoherent. You will suffer. If your hangovers are anything like mine, you'll want to hide in a corner somewhere, not pair, talk, argue, draw, explain. And all with the same person for the next 6 hours.

### What you tell other colleagues
When ex-colleagues, techies and others in the industry ask about pairing, you tend to recite (unintentionally) from the first paragraph of [Pair Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) from Extreme Programming. With emphasis on how the output is of equivalent content but increased __quality__.

So what's the truth then?

### The truth
I can tell you my opinion.

I think pairing is hard. It's hard because it's mostly about people, it's a people problem. And people problems are inherently hard.

### Why does that make it hard?
Have you ever booked a holiday with you nan/girlfriend/best friend/close colleague. After about the second day on holiday you discovered that they are a pain in the $Â£%e to spend all day with. If you picked girlfriend above it's probably time to bail, otherwise I'd say that's pretty normal. On said holiday, did you try and choose a place to eat? For me this is the most frustrating thing and most likely to cause an argument. 

You may have a different trigger. 

My point is, even two close people have problems working together on something as relaxing as a holiday. Try putting two average Joes together using several constrained resources and see what happens.

To be blunt, people are weird. Well, they are different.

## People are different
When you pair you work very closely. You're sat at the same desk side by side, all day. You're sharing the same physical resources, passing them between each other. People have very different ideas and tolerances about things like personal space and personal habits. 

### Personal space
Personal space is something you have to be very careful and considerate of and there are no hard and fast guidelines.

### Personal habits
Some personal habits can be extremely irritating to a pair I'm thinking nose picking and nail biting. Yes those bits do fall between the __shared__ keyboard.

### Shy
Everyone has a different level of communication skill. Not everyone is as forthcoming with their opinion as they could be, some are a little too forthcoming. It's all too easy for a quiet person to get detached from the driver and the longer it lasts the more detached (and probably frustrated) they become.

### Outbursts
With differences of opinion, strategy or implementation comes frustration. Outbursts and stern arguments can happen.
- Attention span
- Me...

### Effective managerial tool

### When pairing is ineffective

### Once you've paired
- You change

### Why I hated it
- 100%
- I'm not a very good pair
- Introverts 

### Starting again?
