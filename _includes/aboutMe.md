### Summary
I'm a professional software developer working in the City of London, living in Surrey. I like anything active especially Snowboarding, Cycling and Running. I'm also a keen [photographer](/photography.html).

### Professional Career
For my day job I'm a professional Java Developer working for a investment bank in the City. I have worked in a broad range of industry sectors from travel, to telecoms to finance. I like my code to be simple and [clean](http://www.cleancoders.com/); I pride myself on quality.

I prefer agile project delivery and have led a sub team for one of the longest running and most successful agile teams in London. I work by the tenets of [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/).

### Coding outside of work
I love coding. Despite being a Java Developer 9-5 I am experienced in many languages and dabble in anything worth learning. My current language of choice is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) but I've also coded in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), Lisp, C, [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and more.

I love learning new technologies and I'm an advocate of open source.

I've got a few projects on [Github](https://github.com/) and have contributed to several open source projects such as [Spring Integration](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration), XWork2 and Twitter's [Ostrich](https://github.com/twitter/ostrich).

### Photography
Did I mention I'm into [photography](/photography) too.

### Snowboarding
If I could go on one holiday a year it would snowboarding. I own a 159cm K2 Believer with Burton Mission bindings, but I need to work on my tricks.

### September
On September the 8th 2012 I will be married to my girlfriend of 10 years. I'm quite excited about it.
