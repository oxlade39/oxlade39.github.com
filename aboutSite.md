### Blog content

The blog posts contained within this site (oxlade39.github.com/) represent my thoughts alone and can not be attributed to any of my employers past or present.

### Why Addicks

Addicks is the nickname of the football club I support, [Charlton Athletic](http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/Welcome). It also represent how I sometimes feel about my personal projects. There's a certain addictive nature to software, those late nights when you just have to fix that bug before bedtime.
